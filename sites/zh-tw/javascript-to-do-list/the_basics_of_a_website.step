## What makes a website?

Modern websites are built using three languages: __HTML, CSS, and JavaScript__.

  * __HTML__ stands for __H__yper-__t__ext __M__arkup __L__anguage. It provides the structure for your website, using a system of nested __tags__.

  * __CSS__ stands for __C__ascading __S__tyle__s__heets. It's a language for creating rules that can select various elements on the page and change their visual properties. A CSS stylesheet is composed of __rules__ that dictate how your site is presented.

  * __JavaScript__ allows users to interact with your website, making it dynamic and customizable. It's a powerful language that can be used for extraordinarily complex tasks.

In this lesson, we'll be reviewing HTML and CSS at a high level, and see how they interact.
You'll need to fire up your text editor for these steps.

First thing's first: we'll be modifying our HTML. Open up index.html in your text editor. You should see something like this:
首先：我們要調整一下我們的 HTML。用文字編輯器打開 index.html 。你會看到像是下面的東西：
<img src='img/text_editor_html.png' alt="image of an html page open in a text editor">

Take a look around. What are the different elements doing? Why are some lines indented deeper
than others? What are those strange series of numbers and ampersands?
看一下，不同的元素有什麼樣的作用？為什麼有些行的程式碼縮排得比較多？那些奇怪的號碼跟 \&記號 是做什麼用的？


Finally, you should find this line of code in index.html:
最後，你應該可以在 index.html 找到這一行：
MARKDOWN
      source_code :html, <<-HTML
        <h1>Your List App</h1>
      HTML
    message "你想叫這個代辦清單應用程式什麼？把 h1 裡的文字改成你想要的。存檔，然後把瀏覽器重新整理。"
  end

Next, we'll be editing our site's look by modifying our CSS. Open up styles.css in your text editor.
Each set of curly braces is a __rule__. It's preceded by a __selector__ that identifies certain HTML
elements on the page. Inside the braces are the rule's __attributes__. Your web browser uses these
attributes to determine how to display your html.

Can you tell which html elements are styled by a given rule? Feel free to change the colors, fonts,
and position of elements to your liking.

There are some complex CSS selectors and attributes in this particular file. Don't worry, we don't
expect you to know everything that's going on, and we won't be writing much CSS going forward in
this lesson. If you are interested, though, flag an instructor and have them explain what a
given attribute or selector does.

We are going to make you style the name of your list, so that it matches the rest of the page.
Find the following rule in styles.css:
MARKDOWN
    source_code :CSS, <<-CSS
      h1 {
        margin: 20px;
      }
    CSS

    message "and add a color attribute, like this:"
    source_code :CSS, <<-CSS
      h1 {
        margin: 20px;
        color: #7d82b0;
      }
  CSS


  end

  step do
    message <<-MARKDOWN
Finally, we're going to remove some of the placeholder HTML on the page. Not everyone wants a gallon of milk! In index.html,
delete everything inside the ul element (lines 15 through 23). index.html should now look like this:
    MARKDOWN

    source_code :HTML, <<-HTML
      <form id='add-form'>
        <input id="create" name="itemDescription" type="text" placeholder="Add something to the list!">
      </form>
      <ul id='list'>
      </ul>
    HTML
  end
